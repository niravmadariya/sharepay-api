Share Pay application APIs

This repository contains APIs for an application SharePay.

SharePay is an application to split the bills among friends.

APIs are created in core PHP (No Language Libraries used).

### Security 
Not Storing any user data in raw format

Created custom crypto provider class to encrypt some data, also using AES256 encryption for encrypting the other data.

## The stack & building from source 
APIs are built upon PHP 7.1

IIS Server

Library - <a href="https://github.com/niravmadariya/sharepay-api/blob/master/php/db_pdo.inc">db_pdo.inc</a> from <a href="https://github.com/niravmadariya/phplib/tree/master/inc/db_pdo.inc">db_pdo.inc</a> for database transactions (with custom updates) 

## Building the Project

### 1. changes in php/local.inc - add your database connection parameter
```
var $Host     = "";
var $Database = "";
var $User     = "";
var $Password = "";
var $charset  = "utf8";


// Replace your own AES 256 Encryption key
$_CONFIG["aes_enc_key"] = "Your AES 256 Key";

// Replace your own AES 256 Encryption key (used by client app to encrypt data, differs from above key)
$_CONFIG["aes_enc_client_key"]="Your Client AES 256 Encrytion key";

// Replace with your own salt to encrypt data 
$_CONFIG["crypto_provider_salt"] = "Your Encryption Salt";

```

### 2. changes in Database - import users.sql and transaction.sql
